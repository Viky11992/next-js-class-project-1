        <p className='text-white text-2xl capitalize hover:text-red-600'>Despite facing imprisonment and relentless political pressure, Imran Khan remains a towering figure in Pakistan's political landscape. Jailed on controversial charges, Khan's influence continues to rally millions of supporters, both at home and abroad. With his conviction labeled as arbitrary by international bodies, Khan's defiant stance against the powerful military establishment keeps him at the center of Pakistanâ€™s future. His vision for a better Pakistan lives on, as the call for his release grows louder by the day.</p>
